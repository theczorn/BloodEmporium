## Overview
- Automatically selects optimal nodes on the Bloodweb based on user-configured preferences.
- Uses a cost algorithm to determine optimally how to select maximal preferred unlockables and minimal undesirable ones.
- Uses game icon files to identify nodes on the Bloodweb.
- Should not be bannable since there are no interactions with the game's memory or process.

## Configuration
- You will be able to set your preferences and dislikes for certain addons, items, offerings and perks.
  - Each unlockable you configure will have a tier and subtier:
    - The higher the tier (or subtier), the higher your preference for that item.
    - The lower the tier (or subtier), the lower your preference for that item.
    - You do not need to configure unlockables for which you have a neutral preference.
    (tier and subtier are both automatically 0 in this case)
      - Any items not in the profile will be assumed to be tier and subtier 0.
    - Tiers and subtiers can be from -999 to 999.
    - Subtier allows for preference within a tier e.g. a tier 3 subtier 3 is higher priority than tier 3 subtier 2.
    - Roughly speaking, two tier 1 unlockables is equivalent in preference to one tier 2 unlockable, and so on.
    (basic maths)
- Each profile can store a different set of preferences, for easy switching when required.

## Features
- Allows user to configure which unlockables are preferred or undesirable.
- Bloodpoint spend limit / prestige level limit.
- Hotkey to run / stop the program (default: Ctrl + Alt + 9).
- Completely automatic and hands-free.

## Issues
- Icon packs with similar-looking icons are more likely to cause incorrect object recognition, which may result in
  incorrect or suboptimal selection.
- Shaders must be disabled while using this program, as colour changes interfere with object and colour recognition.

## Known Bugs
- Slight inaccuracies in detecting which unlockables are connected (especially as of Patch 6.4.0).

## Roadmap & Future Developments
- Improved speed
- Blind mode (selects random nodes blindly - a very fast alternative for those who don't care about what items they get)
